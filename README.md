📌 Credit Card Fraud Detection (Machine Learning Project)

This project builds a machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the popular Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset.
The data is highly imbalanced, and the goal is to create a model that maximizes fraud recall while keeping false alarms controlled.


🚀 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major challenge for banks and financial institutions.
Even a small number of fraudulent transactions leads to large financial losses.

This project aims to:

Detect fraudulent transactions (Class 1)

Minimize financial loss

Reduce false alerts to maintain customer experience

Build a complete ML pipeline from EDA → Modeling → Evaluation → Threshold Tuning → Deployment
